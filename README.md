# Just Flap It!



### END-TO-END ENCRYPTION, EVERYTIME

Our team would not learn anything should they decide to tear open your packages in transit--you can rest assured that no one but the recipient knows what's in your package, thanks to *state-of-the-art crowptography*.

### DIRECT CAWMMUNICATION

Your packages are directly transmitted to the device you intend to. *There are no middlebirds during the transit*. To ensure reliability, crows may still communicate with the rest of the flock to determine the recipient's final location. This does not affect your privacy, and will become optional in the future.
                
### CROWCURRENT

You may transfer *more than one file at a time*. Just throw them to the crows, and they'll take care of the rest.
